# Installation

Getting the OpenRemote components downloaded and  installed should take less than one hour. The installation process consists of three steps:

* Download and installation of the OpenRemote Controller software
* Download and installation of the OpenRemote mobile  client app

##OpenRemote Professional Designer Account Registration

If you are a private or educational user, or if you want to trial the software as a company, on the right hand side of the window, under *Order Summary*, select *Add Coupon* and enter PRIVUNIV. Then select *APPLY* , which reduces your order total to 0 US$, then select *SUBMIT YOUR ORDER*.
